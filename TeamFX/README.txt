Notes or comments to the grader: In addition to the function the assignment asked, 
We check whether filename the user give is exist and check whether the current number
of question is positive before running the quiz. And We generate random quiz based
on the number of each topic. If one topic has huge number of question, the user would
solve questions about the topic.
